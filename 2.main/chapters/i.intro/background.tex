\chapter{Fabrication of Interactive Objects} \label{ch:background}
  The construction of interactive objects using digital fabrication equipment
  has been a popular topic in the HCI literature in recent years. Researchers
  have proposed a variety of techniques for constructing objects that can sense
  user's interactions including acoustic, electric, optic, and pneumatic
  methods, as presented in an exploration of the design space carried out by
  Ballagas \etal. This chapter, in contrast, aims to highlight how \pap each
  previous effort is.
